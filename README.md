# Final Project - Contact database (Create / Read / Update / Delete)

Database will be in 2 parts. 

1. Table view --> 
  Using .js to dinamicly generate table with all the elements in it. Data for the contacts are stored in separate file instead of pulling them from API all the time.
2. Grid view -->
  Using .js to dinamicly generate <div> and other necessary elements. Data for the contacts are stored in separate file instead of pulling them from API all the time.

On both views will be user will be able to Add, Edit, View and Delete contacts. 

For the benefit of the project and responsivnes and speed of the app, all data containing user / contact details are writen in separate file (fetched-data.js).

Also, navigation bar is written in separate file and using jQuery inserted into all .html files.
